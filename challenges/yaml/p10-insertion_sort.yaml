  # Problem Description
  
  Implement a function `insertion_sort` that takes in an array of integers and sorts them in ascending order using the Insertion Sort algorithm.
  
  Insertion Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It works by iterating over the array and repeatedly inserting the current element into its correct position among the previously sorted elements.
  
  Your task is to write the `insertion_sort` function that performs the Insertion Sort algorithm and returns the sorted array.
  
  ## Example
  
  ```python
  Input: [5, 2, 8, 12, 1]
  Output: [1, 2, 5, 8, 12]
  ```
  
  ## Constraints
  
  * The input array will contain at most 1000 elements.
  * Each element in the array is an integer with a value between -1000 and 1000.
