  # Problem Description
  
  Implement a function `merge_sort` that takes in an array of integers and sorts them in ascending order using the Merge Sort algorithm.
  
  Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by recursively dividing the array into two halves, sorting each half, and then merging the two sorted halves into a single sorted array.
  
  Your task is to write the `merge_sort` function that performs the Merge Sort algorithm and returns the sorted array.
  
  ## Example
  
  ```python
  Input: [5, 2, 8, 12, 1]
  Output: [1, 2, 5, 8, 12]
  ```
  
  Note that the input and output arrays are shown as lists for clarity, but your `merge_sort` function should work with regular arrays as well.
  
  ## Constraints
  
  * The input array will contain at most 1000 elements.
  * Each element in the array is an integer with a value between -1000 and 1000.
